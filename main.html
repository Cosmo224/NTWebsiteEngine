   <p>"I was a young man when the Plague came, twenty-seven years old; and I lived on the other side of San Francisco Bay, in Berkeley. You remember those great stone houses, Edwin, when we came down the hills from Contra Costa? That was where I lived, in those stone houses. I was a professor of English literature." Much of this was over the heads of the boys.</p> <!--Change this text!-->
